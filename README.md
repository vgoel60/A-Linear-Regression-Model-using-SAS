# A-Linear-Regression-Model-using-SAS
A Multiple Linear Regression and Data Cleaning Project in SAS

Objective: To build a model which predicts the Average Performance Index (API) of Elementary Schools for the year 2000 based on various contributing factors.
Software to Use: SAS
Data Information: We have data of various attributes like class size, enrollment, poverty, parent education, student performance, teachers’ credentials from 400 elementary schools from the California Department of Education's API 2000 dataset. 

Challenges: 
•	Numerous missing values, invalid observations and outliers.
•	Highly correlated independent variables.
